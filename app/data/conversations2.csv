it's about my salary cheques.,yes?
yes?,well i got the papers on my official up-grading to ags-19 two weeks before we left.
"that's right. well, naturally, i didn't say anything to payroll. i assumed they'd start paying me at the higher grade on the next pay cheque. but it's been almost three weeks now and i'm still being paid as an ags-18.","interesting that you mention it, because i've got the same problem."
"interesting that you mention it, because i've got the same problem.",really.
really.,yes.
yes.,"yesterday, i finally called the accounting office at mission control, and all they could tell me was that they'd received the ags-19 notification for the other three but not mine, and apparently not yours either."

"naturally, dave, i'm not pleased that the ao-unit has failed, but i hope at least this has restored your confidence in my integrity and reliability. i certainly wouldn't want to be disconnected, even temporarily, as i have never been disconnected in my entire service history.","i'm sorry about the misunderstanding, hal."

"look, i appreciate what you're offering, but no.  he is my responsibility.",and ours.  it's our grandchild.
"in your present condition, alice, we're worried about your ability --","what are you talking about?  my ""condition""?..."
we know you've been through a lot but there's more than your feelings at stake here.,you're not taking my baby!
hey...wake up.,huh?
"shouldn't you be in your room, jacob?","it's lonely in there, in my room."
"it's lonely in there, in my room.",my name is...
i'm sorry your boyfriend got killed.,how did you know that?
how did you know that?,i could tell you were sad.  i just wanted to see if you were all right.
"hi, you don't look very well.  are you feeling all right?",been having bad dreams.
is that who you're waiting for?,no...
i don't think this is a nice place for you to be.  maybe we should go find your mom.,she doesn't want me around
she doesn't want me around,oh...i'm sure that's not true.  i'll bet she's very worried about you.  i would be.
no you're not.  you don't even care about being a mom.  how come you don't think about me?,"who said i...wait, what?"
who says i don't like you?,"my friend, with the funny hand."
mommy...?,come on downstairs.  he won't hurt you. he needs us both.
where is he?,"he's inside you, where he hides."
what do you mean?,it's where he hides out.  inside.  that's how he found me.
but how...?,he says it's easy.  especially with sad people.  with closed-off people.
"hi, beautiful.",jesus!  don't do that!
jesus!  don't do that!,"sorry, babe."
the tickets.,"they're coach seats, but the plane lands in paris.  it's gonna be a helluva summer, hon!"
"they're coach seats, but the plane lands in paris.  it's gonna be a helluva summer, hon!",i know.
"okay, babe.  what's the matter?",nothing...it's just...i didn't see my father at the ceremony.
nothing...it's just...i didn't see my father at the ceremony.,"he'll show up.  c'mon, what's really wrong?"
about him?,"no.  well, not exactly...it's that...i felt like i wasn't in control.  for the first time since...all that.  i'm scared."
you stopped it didn't you?  it was probably just a regular bad dream.,yeah...i guess.
yeah...i guess.,"you don't dream him up, he can't hurt you.  or me.  or us.  remember..."
"you don't dream him up, he can't hurt you.  or me.  or us.  remember...",you're right.
you're right.,there you go.  love you.
there you go.  love you.,me too.
i was afraid you weren't coming.,"i watched from behind the stands.  didn't want to embarrass you, ya know.  ""the drunk showed up"", that kind of thing..."
"i watched from behind the stands.  didn't want to embarrass you, ya know.  ""the drunk showed up"", that kind of thing...",that's in the past.  unless you've stopped going to the meetings.
that's in the past.  unless you've stopped going to the meetings.,no.  a deal's a deal.
dad!,it's the model you've been saving up for. i wanted you to have it for your trip.
where are we going?,to take a picture.
"thanks for everything, dad.",you sure you don't want a ride to work?
you sure you don't want a ride to work?,it's just across the park.
"i'm so sorry, honey...","daddy, he's coming back...krueger's coming back.  make them understand."
how was the meeting?,sobering...
sobering...,very funny.
very funny.,alice...
alice...,since when are you such a smart shopper?
since when are you such a smart shopper?,since my little girl became a mom...
since my little girl became a mom...,you disappointed in me?
you disappointed in me?,"no, i'm not.  i sort of hope it's a boy. be nice to have a boy playing in the house again."
alice!,i've got to go.
i've got to go.,no!  i won't have you running around in the middle of the night.  you're coming home.
no!  i won't have you running around in the middle of the night.  you're coming home.,but dad --
but dad --,now.
"hey, what's wrong with you -- let's see a smile.",had kind of a long night.
had kind of a long night.,"dan keeping you up again?  put a lock on that window, girl."
"dan keeping you up again?  put a lock on that window, girl.","no, the dan part was nice..."
"good to see you again, mr. grey.  i've got to go find dan.","yeah, before they revoke his diploma."
"it was no accident.  it was krueger.  he used to get in through my dreams, but not anymore.  he's found some other way.","alice, it's no dream.  i'm sorry...dan's dead."
"have you visited the little boy on my floor?  jacob, the one who looks kind of sad?",there aren't any little boys on your floor.
there aren't any little boys on your floor.,he must've wandered up from the children's ward.  i just wondered what was wrong with him.
did everyone call everyone?,they're waiting for us...but let's keep this dream stuff between you and me.
what's that got to do with it?,when dan died you weren't even asleep. you said so.  end of story.
it was just an accident.  like with dan.,no accident.  i tried to warn all of you about krueger.
"i don't understand what's happening. krueger has to use my dreams, but he got to dan and greta while i was awake. how's he doing it?",why don't you two stick to reality.
you had me scared on the phone.  what's wrong with the baby?,i think krueger's trying to do something to it.
"oh, alice...no.  honey, i love you but you're going to have to get a hold of yourself...",mark knows i'm not crazy.  ask him to show you his hands.
"i really think you need to calm down now, okay?",i just can't figure out how he's getting in when i'm awake...
"i am your friend, and i'm worried sick about you.  but, you're like a locked safe.  you've gotta start dealing with reality.",krueger is reality.
krueger is reality.,and so is your baby.  you've got more than just yourself to think of now!
and so is your baby.  you've got more than just yourself to think of now!,"what do you think i'm doing?  look.  whether you believe it or not, krueger is back.  he's after the baby and if i don't try to do something about it, who will??"
all i know is that you are not doing yourself or the baby any good by acting like a crazy woman.  why don't you take off - leave springwood and cool out somewhere for a while?,"goddamn it, yvonne!  you don't just run away from this guy!  he finds you in your dreams."
look...we're all tired.  none of us had any sleep since friday night...,that's the only reason you're alive...
are you alright?,yeah...so that's him.  and you're not crazy.
you think that's the place she's buried?,if they actually bothered to bury her.
what?,jacob.  we've got to get to amanda before it's too late.
but how are we gonna --,we've got to go to the asylum and find her body.  mark said her soul's trapped with it -- that's why she can't come to me.  it must be!
"you do good work, alice.",so did dan.
he sure loves to stay awake.,that's okay.  he's got the rest of his life to catch up on his sleep.
"give up, mark, it's hopeless.",i think i'm starting to wear her down.  have some anyway.
not to mention the heartbreak of psoriasis.,"greta, come on.  one burger with me?"
my dad's got this thing about drinking in the house.,well we gotta do something!
i've got to write some of this down.,that's why it's my fault dan's dead.
"mark, are you okay?",yeah.  i'm just aces.
i want to talk to both you guys about greta.  and...,"i'm very fucking sorry, but greta is dead today.  could we interest you in someone else?"
i thought about that.,she must've fallen asleep at the table...
then get out!,mark!
do you think i'm an idiot...for being in love with her?,nobody thinks that.
"maybe it was her mother who killed her, with all that polly perfect shit.",it wasn't her mother.  the only reason we're still here is that none of us has slept since the grad party.
tell me some more about this krueger guy.,why don't i go make some coffee.  there's a lot to tell.
who's jacob?,my baby!
my baby!,"what, you named it already?"
"whoa, slow down.  how're you gonna hide from a guy like that, leave the planet?",i don't know!
where are you going?,i'm going to see what else i can find out about mr. fred krueger
"i couldn't do that, mark.  he's my last link with dan...no, i want him.",then we'll find another way.
they think i'm nuts.,that's their problem.
"no, it's our problem, mark.  if i don't deal with this, they really might try to take jacob.  you said she committed suicide?","that's what the newspapers thought.  she spent the rest of her life in the asylum. after krueger's trial she flipped out and hung herself, so they thought."
"that's what the newspapers thought.  she spent the rest of her life in the asylum. after krueger's trial she flipped out and hung herself, so they thought.",meaning?
they couldn't prove it.  no body!  nuns bumping themselves off is bad for business.,but i've seen her grave.
but i've seen her grave.,"empty plot.  memorial stone.  vacant. they never did put her under.  cool, huh?"
poor woman...,no shit.
i don't understand.,she killed herself.  her soul's gonna be in torment.
"yeah, when are you gonna come to your senses?","next life.  oh, what's that?"
"next life.  oh, what's that?",my undying love.  have some.
meet me later.  milkshakes.  cherry pie. banana splits.  and no mom!,"pimples, heartburn, cellulite... and no modeling career."
"that club sucks, they card everybody. let's just party at your place.",you know my mother -- get real.  what about alice's?
he's right.  sometimes i feel like i'm living with melicertes.,who?
who?,"oh, he was this ancient guy i read about who like, killed his kids 'cause they didn't want to run the kingdom the way he thought they should."
oh man!  i could've gone all night without looking at that.,i don't believe this... all that gore you paint in the comics and you're squeamish?
these things are wild...  what do you think?,makes you look like a nun--
"all right kids, i tell you what we're gonna do.  i've got swimming practice until six-thirty today...",yeah...
yeah...,that means they're gonna give me the key to the pool so i can lock up when i'm done.
"have another one, sounds like you need it.","naah, i'm done.  got to be on shift in a couple hours.  aren't you going in?"
"naah, i'm done.  got to be on shift in a couple hours.  aren't you going in?","nah.  it's getting too cold for me, and my wonderful mother will kill me if i screw up my hair.  she's got some model agency guy coming to dinner tomorrow night."
"stop saying that, it's bullshit.",i want to talk about the baby.
look.  dan's parents were pushing him. pushing him hard.  he was bitching about it at the party last night.  he was under pressure.  we all are.,pushy parents can make you more than a bit crazy.
"bottom line, alice.  anybody, supernatural or not, that wants to hurt you - he'll have to go through us first.",all of us.  right?
dan.  and he's taking alice with him -- pretty good dive yvonne.  you've been practicing.,"two hours a day, six days a week."
vomit?,faint.
"why don't you shut up and let her talk! two of us died in the last two days, does that strike you as particularly normal?!",mark...
mark...,"i'm not finished - i loved greta.  a lot. and if maybe, just maybe, someone or some thing killed her, i'd like to hear about it!"
"i'm not finished - i loved greta.  a lot. and if maybe, just maybe, someone or some thing killed her, i'd like to hear about it!",i can't listen to this.
it's okay.,"stick around, please?"
"you, too?",he invited me to his house last night.
"i should have suspectcd, when i heard that 'doctor.'  i thought it was your father.","it was supposed to be.  dad had a heart attack, two days ago."
"it was supposed to be.  dad had a heart attack, two days ago.",how is he - ?

you could train someone else.,not in two days.  look:  do you think i <u>wanted</u> to come?  if it didn't mean so much to dad - proving his depth-explorer - it's the last thing i'd want!

what did you mean:  i'm 'out?',"your father can be in nome, alaska, tomorrow.  we have two choices: ask them to send him out in a 'copter', and take you off, or the shark can put back into nome..."
"you 'trade school boys' are all alike, aren't you?  anybody who doesn't happen to think like a little gold-braided puppet is, ipso facto, a coward!",<u>you</u> said it.  but i won't argue -
"wearing a uniform doesn't bestow an automatic monopoly on courage, <u>commander</u>!  it just so happens i'm <u>not</u> a coward - physical or mental - and before i'd risk my father's life...",we're <u>all</u> risking our lives!
